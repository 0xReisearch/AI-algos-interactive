# Interactive AI Algorithms

An interactive visualization platform for understanding AI/ML algorithms. Each algorithm is presented with real-time visualization and interactive elements to help users understand how they work.

## Current Algorithms
- **Naive Bayes Text Classifier**: Interactive demonstration of text classification with probabilities visualization
- (More algorithms coming soon...)
